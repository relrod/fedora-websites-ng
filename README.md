# fedora-websites-ng

This is purely a playground repo for now, there's a good chance we will never
use it, but alas, it's a place to experiment.

For those who care:

* Install Hugo (I used
  [a copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/daftaupe/hugo/) for a newer
  version, but a version of Hugo *is* packaged in Fedora already.)
* `cd getfedora.org`
* `hugo server -D --disableFastRender`
